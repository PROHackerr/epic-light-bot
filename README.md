You can find this bot on Telegram: @EpicLightBot  

This started as something very small and grew to be bigger than I imagined. Didn't plan to make it public previously as the API keys were exposed, now I don't really care so here it is.  

Might abandon this soon since I'm already working on a new version `epic-light-bot-v2`.  

To use this bot, just add it in a group or message it.  

I'll add some useful stuff on this Readme later(maybe?).
